**Observations and Reflections**

By Peter Kravsky

I was able to give examples both simple and one that is a bit harder. I like the fact that the sample exercises are easy to try out with a freely available IDE online called Replit from [https://replit.com](https://replit.com/) without a complex operating system environment and program setup. Using an online IDE gives users account access and complete flexibility to practice programming in Lua, from any device connected to the internet.

From the experience of writing the lesson, I learned that it will be helpful to give more examples and code challenges applicable to a job or everyday events that require repetition such as tasks reminder, create a daily log file or creating templates.

In addition, I would expand the lesson plan and give students the opportunity to take turns after the discussion of each exercise. I would add exercises and assignments that would incorporate collaborative learning strategies where students work together to solve a problem, get students more involved in the discussion or answer a question about an assigned coding challenge.
